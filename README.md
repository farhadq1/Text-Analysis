# Text-Analysis

Stored my thesis as a .txt file to only include text. Imported it in python and performed some cleaning, stemming and created a bar plot to see the frequency of words I used. Since the thesis was related auditory signal processing in the brain, most words that I used were related to sound signals and their properties. This will be helpful in mentioning the keywords for publications.
